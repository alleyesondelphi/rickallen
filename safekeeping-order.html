                    <p><em>Two and a half hours in, Holeman hissy fit arrested Richard Allen for withstanding Holeman's attempts to berate, threaten, and leverage him into conceding to lies about witnesses, experts, and evidence.</em></p>
                    <p><em>Holeman then drove Richard Allen to Delphi, Indiana and booked him into the Carroll County Jail under an alias.</em></p>
                    <p><em>Please note the cuts in the "accidental interrogation" video were the portions of the interrogation that were excluded as a result of the Court's decision to exlcude the 3rd party suspects that, at the time of theinterrogation, law enforcement wrongly believed that Richard Allen was not only connected to, but assisted in killing Abby and Libby. At this time, law enforcement believed Richard Allen was the nexus they needed to Tony and <strong><a class="link" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aKXLbQFj23s64yLl33q_8SEhNbrWQ1LG/view?usp=drive_link" target="_blank">Kegan Kline</a></strong>.</p>
                    <p>The portion showing Holeman mirandizing Richard Allen, however, was not cut from the video&mdash;Holeman just simply failed to mirandize him.</p>
                    <p><em><strong>State Exhibit 200</strong> &mdash; Following the hissy fit arrest, Tony Liggett, then just a detective, prepared a <strong><a link="link" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1h3lamwJ0VGsVuFJjI0w8uRo3KqZe8s3k/view?usp=drive_link" target="_blank">Probable Cause Affidavit</a></strong> that put false words in the victim's mouth about a gun&mdash;likely due to the obvious fact that there was no probable cause to arrest Richard Allen with without the entirely manufactured use of a gun in this crime.</em></p>

                    <p><em>A video recovered from Liberty's phone on February 15, 2017 shows Abigail walking southeast on the Monon High Bridge while an unknown male wearing a blue windbreaker, jeans, boots, and a baseball cap walking behind her. As Abigail approaches Liberty at the end of the bridge, Liberty is heard saying, “This is the path that we go down. There's no path going there so we have to go down here.” 12 seconds later, an unknown male is heard faintly in the background saying, “Guys, down the hill.” The video ends four seconds later.</em></p>
                    <p><em>On page 2 of Liggett's affidavit, he told the judge, "The video recovered from Victim 2's phone shows Victim 1 walking southeast on the Monon High Bridge while a male subject wearing a dark jacket and jeans walks behind her. As the male subject approaches Victim 1 and Victim 2, one of the victims mentions, "gun.” Near the end of the video a male is seen and heard telling the girls, "Guys, Down the hill.” The girls then begin to proceed down the hill and the video ends."</em></p>
