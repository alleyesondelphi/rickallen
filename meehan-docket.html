              <li>On April 5, 2024, Defendant Shane Meehan filed a notice of insanity defense under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 12.2(a). Dkt. 122. The government has filed a motion under Rule 12.2(c) for an order that Mr. Meehan undergo a mental health examination under 18 U.S.C. 4242 regarding the existence of insanity at the time of the offense. Dkt. 123. The parties agree that Mr. Meehan's mental health examination should include evaluation of his sanity at the time of the offense. See dkt. 121 at 4. The government's motion is therefore GRANTED. Dkt. (123). IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED THAT: (1) The defendant, during the time he is committed to the custody of the U.S. Attorney General or his designee at Federal Medical Center-Butner for competency re-examination pursuant to the Court's March 27, 2024 Order, dkt. 121, shall be examined by one or more qualified psychiatrists or psychologists to determine the existence of insanity at the time of the offense charged in the indictment. (2) At the conclusion of the examination and evaluation of the defendant in accordance with this order, clinicians shall make and file with the Court a report of findings with copies provided to defense counsel and to the attorneys for the United States. (3) Any delay from any examination of the defendant pursuant to this Order shall be excluded from the Speedy Trial Act's time computations. See 18 U.S.C. § 3161(h)(1)(A), (h)(1)(D), (h) (h) (h)(4).

            <ul class="docket-entry">
              <li>On this date, Defendant Shane M. Meehan appeared in person and by counsel, Monica Foster, Joseph Martin Cleary, and Gwendolyn M. Beitz, for a competency hearing. The government appeared by counsel, Assistant United States Attorney Lindsay E. Karwoski and Kathryn E. Olivier, with its investigative agent, Special Agent Willmann. The hearing was recorded by Court Reporter Jodie Franzen. The Court confirmed that counsel agree that Mr. Meehan is not competent to stand trial at this point. The Court ADOPTED the findings of Mr. Meehan's competency evaluation filed on October 23, 2024. Sealed Dkts. 128 and 129. Dkt. 128 and dkt. 131 were admitted by the Court as exhibits. The Court found by a preponderance of the evidence that Mr. Meehan is presently suffering from a mental disease rendering him mentally incompetent to the extent that he is unable to understand the nature and the consequences of the proceedings against him or to assist properly in his defense. The Court commits Mr. Meehan to the custody of the Attorney General. The Attorney General shall hospitalize Mr. Meehan in accordance with the requirements of 18 United States Code § 4241(d). Specifically, Mr. Meehan shall be hospitalized for treatment in a suitable facility for a reasonable period of time, not exceeding four months, as is necessary to determine whether there is a substantial probability that in the foreseeable future, he will attain the capacity to permit the proceedings to go forward. If necessary, the hospitalization may be extended for an additional reasonable period until his mental condition is so improved. The Court orders the facility to file a report no later than four months after Mr. Meehan is committed to the Attorney General's custody. This report should outline the treatment he has received and provide the facility's assessment of his mental competency. If the facility determines sooner that Mr. Meehan has attained the necessary capacity to continue the proceedings, the report will be due at the time of that determination. The parties shall file a status report with their positions as to the defendant's competency, within 14 days of the facility's report being filed, after which the Court shall set a hearing date.</li>

            <ul class="docket-entry">
              <li>The Court has ordered that Defendant, Shane Meehan, be committed to the custody of the Attorney General for competency restoration proceedings. Dkt. 136. The government has filed a motion to amend that order so that an evaluation for insanity at the time of offense will also be completed "if clinical staff deems the competency restoration process successful." Dkt. 140. Mr. Meehan opposes that motion, arguing there must be "a judicial finding of Mr. Meehan's competency prior to a sanity evaluation being conducted." Dkt. 142 at 2. Nothing in Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 12.2, however, requires a judicial competency finding before an insanity evaluation. Instead, that rule requires that "the court must, upon the government's motion, order the defendant to be examined" for insanity at the time of the offense. Fed. R. Cr. P. 12.2(c)(1)(B). The statutes governing such an examination similarly do not require a prior judicial competency finding. See 18 U.S.C. §§ 4242(a), 4247(b),(c). Mr. Meehan argues that due process requires the Court to find Mr. Meehan competent before an insanity evaluation may be done, but he cites no supporting authority. See dkt. 142 at 2. While due process protects Mr. Meehan from being tried while he is incompetent, he does not explain why that right would extend to prohibit an insanity evaluation before it's been determined whether Mr. Meehan has been restored to competence. See Medina v. California, 505 U.S. 437, 446-448, 453 (1992) ('[T]raditionally, duc process has required that only the most basic procedural safeguards be observed."); Yang v. United States, 114 F.4th 899, 909 (7th Cir. 2024) ("Competency pertains to a singular due process right to a fair trial under the Fifth Amendment."). Finally, Mr. Mechan argues that a "sanity evaluation conducted on a patient who is incompetent would lack even a modicum of reliability." Dkt. 142 at 1. But that could be true only if Mr. Meehan remains incompetent at the time of the insanity evaluation, which can be addressed as necessary at the upcoming competency hearing. See Yang, 114 F.4th at 906-07 ('[B]ecause a defendant may fit in-and-out of competency, a trial court must always be alert to circumstances suggesting a change that would render the accused unable to meet the standards of competency to stand trial."). If an insanity evaluation is going to be done, it makes the most sense to have it conducted within close proximity to completion of the restoration process. See id. Conducting an insanity evaluation before a competency hearing will not influence the Court's competency determination &mdash; the Court understands that Mr. Mcchan's competency to stand trial and his sanity at the time of the offense are separate concepts. See 18 U.S.C. S§ 4241(d) (requiring the court to determine competency by a preponderance of the evidence); 4242 (determination of the existence of sanity at the time of the offense); 4247(d) (addressing a defendant's rights at a competency hearing). The government's motion for an insanity evaluation if clinical stall at FMC-Butner opine that Mr. Meehan is competent is GRANTED. Dkt. [140]. IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED THAT: (1) If clinical staff at FMC-Butner opine that Mr. Meehan's competency has been restored, Mr. Meehan shall then be examined by one or more qualified psychiatrists or psychologists to evaluate the existence of insanity at the time of the offense charged in the indictment. (2) At the conclusion of the examination and evaluation of Mr. Meehan in accordance with this order, clinicians shall make and file with the Court a report of findings with copies provided to defense counsel and to the attorneys for the United States. (3) Any delay from any examination of the defendant pursuant to this Order shall be excluded from the Speedy Trial Act's time computations. See 18 U.S.C. § 3161(h)(1)(A), (b)(1)(D), (b)(1)(H), (h)(4). The government shall provide a copy of this order to the appropriate staff at FMC Butner. SO ORDERED. Date: 3/10/2025
