Theresa said on their way home, they saw a guy with no teeth who was wearing all black. She said he turned around when they saw him. Theresa saw him walking toward the green gate by their house but as they approached, he stopped and started walking the opposite way. He was dressed for cold weather even tho it wasn't cold out. She described a white scruffy beard, a big hat &mdash; maybe a knit cap &mdash; and a scarf across his chin. He grinned at Theresa and she thinks she saw silver caps on his teeth. He also had high cheekbones.</li>

                  <li><strong>Sometime around lunchtime:</strong> Libby asked her grandmother, Becky Patty, if her and Abby could go to the High Bridge. “Becky, distracted with work-related obligations, told the girls that they could go to the trail if they could get a ride there and a ride back. She was too busy to drive them herself. Anna was at work at a local restaurant that afternoon, one of her two jobs, so she could not provide transportation either. Anna tells us that Abby had not asked her if it was okay for her to go to the trails that day.” “At this point, Libby implored Kelsi to drive them to the trail. Kelsi had her driver's license, and she was planning on meeting up with her boyfriend, Chase, before having to go to work at 4.30 at Dairy Queen. She initially refused to drive the girls, but eventually, after they begged, she gave in, but only if they could find a ride home. Libby led her grandmother and sister to believe that she had lined up a ride home with her father, Derrick, saying that he had agreed to pick them up between 3 o'clock and 3:30. It appears that Libby actually did not phone Derrick until the girls had already arrived at the trail, but as Libby knew he would, he agreed to meet the girls and drive them home at the end of their hike.”</li>

                        <li>Anna Spath described the male as an older man walking on the trails as they were leaving and she described him as "kinda creepy". In a text from Anna to Kyla Brummett (from 2017?), Anna described the man as wearing "like blue jeans a like really light blue jacket his hair was gray maybe a little brown and he did not really show his face". Investigator Steve Mullin and Brent Ingram interviewed Anna (when?) and she described the male as wearing a blue jacket and light blue (faded) blue jeans. The jacket was a canvas duck type jacket.</li>

                        <li>Railly Voorhies told LE that she said "Hi" to the man but he just glared at them. She recalled him being in all black and had something covering his mouth. Railly recalled telling her sister that someone was in a grumpy mood (Anna or Isabella?). She went on to describe him as "not very tall" and a bigger build. She said that he was not bigger than 5'10". Railly said he was wearing a black hoodie, black jeans, and black boots and that he had his hands in his pockets.</li>
                        <li>At trial, Railly testified that she didn't see anyone else while walking back toward FB to head home. Railly said she passed a man near FB on her walk home and that she had to be home by 2:30 pm.</li>
                        <li>In 2017, Railly told LE she had been saying hi to everybody that they passed on the trail because it's a small community like that and people are friendly and they say hi to each other. This guy however did not say hi back and they got creepy weird vibes from him. Railly said he had a running mask over his mouth and up to his nose and he had his hands in his pockets. Railly told Mullin the guy was in his early 20s/30s, bigger build, larger man, Caucasian, brown eyes, square jaw, wrinkly face, wearing black jeans, a black hoodie, black boots and a black mask, dirty blonde, curly hair that was visible outside of the hoodie.</li>

                        <li>In 2020, Bre told LE that after she took the picture of the bench at 1:26 pm, they started walking back toward FB and that's when they walked past the man. Bre described him as wearing a blue or black windbreaker jacket. She stated the jacket had a collar and he had his hood up from the clothing underneath the jacket. Bre advised he was wearing baggy jeans and was taller than her. She stated her head came up to approximately his shoulder. Bre told investigators Railly said hi to the man and he said nothing back. Bre said the man was walking with a purpose like he knew where he was going. Bre also stated the man had his hands in his pockets and kept his head down. She didn't get a good look at his face but believed he was a white male.</li>
                        <li>At trial, Bre testified that she spoke to the police later that evening because she had been on the High Bridge that day. She gave a statement about the people that she had seen on the trail (what people?). Bre told police the unknown male was “walking with a purpose” and, as she stood next to him walking by, she was as tall as his upper forearm. She said that he was muscular. He was a younger guy in his early 30s but he had something on his head so she wasn't able to see the hair.</li>

                  <li><strong>Approx 1:56 pm:</strong> Betsy sees an unknown male on MHB. She described him as in his 20s or 30s with brown poofy hair. She described him as beautiful in his appearance, average height, not short, and no facial hair. She described him as “as if he was looking for somebody” because he was looking away and then when he saw her approach, he turned and looked at her. They momentarily made eye contact and she just got the impression that he was waiting for somebody or looking for somebody who was on their way. After Betsy turned around to continue her walk, she saw 2 girls. They were just walking and chatting quietly and didn't seem to really notice her or pay attention to her. Betsy looked through yearbooks and had never seen this 20-year-old before. She said the sketch Taylor Bryant drew was a 10/10.</li>

Or Erskine?), saw something out of the corner of his eye, some movement through the dense trees across the creek. Looking through his phone's camera, he zoomed in on the area and saw two deer standing in the woods. But something else was there. Kelsi recalls that moment. So what he did was he put his phone up, and because he found a shoe, he knew that they had to have went across, or they were in that general area that he was in. And so what he did was he turned on his camera, and he looked forward, and he didn't see them at first. And so he went up from there, and he zoomed in, and that's how he saw the deer. If the deer wouldn't have moved, he wouldn't have seen them. As Kelsi said, peering through his phone's camera at the two does in the woods, the man panned down. And what he saw immediately told him that their search would not have a happy ending. Kelsi could not see anything from where she stood, but she tells us, I had a feeling that it wasn't good by the way their voices sounded when they were yelling that they found them. I wanted to be hopeful, but I think when they said the word bodies, it brushed into me and it told me they're not here anymore.</li>

                  <li>Erskine recalled Deputy Yoder arriving along with Ello and 2 people he didn't know (Giancola? And Yoder?). Erskine said he didn't see the bodies until Ello pointed them out. </li>

One of the people Ello was with was a relative (David Erskine?) and that relative was carrying a 9 mm but Ello was not carrying a weapon that day.</li>

                  <li><strong>Approx 1:45 to 2:00 pm:</strong> Page, Olehy, Datzman, and Cody evaluated the evidentiary value of everything in “ground zero”.</li>
                  <li>Page suggested and made a recommendation to bring in a blood spatter expert based at least in part on the stain on the F tree. He agreed that it seems like it might have been an intentional marking and not a random spatter, so he recommended a crime of a blood spatter expert to go in and analyze that.</li>
                  <li>Page said the 3 crime scene investigators (Olehy, Datzman, and Sgt. Cody?) discussed the sticks found on, between, and near the girls' bodies and decided not to even bother trying to get DNA off of the sticks because they determined they had no evidentiary value.</li>
                  <li>Page said a different crime scene tech (Olehy or Datzman?) checked multiple times for body fluids, things beyond blood, looking for semen, saliva, sweat, etc that typically shows up through reagents or with the light. CSI's used an alternate light source and wore orange/yellow filter goggles to enable them to see the fluorescence of body fluids. They weren't seeing any body fluid but the one guy who wasn't wearing goggles, Datzman, kept seeing something sparkling while they were shining the light over it. This was the unspent cartridge. It was partially buried underneath some leaves. Page described removing leaves to be able to get a clear view of it and it was at an approximate 45-degree angle into the ground. The primer end was visible but you never actually see the bullet end of this cartridge. Page said the primer was in the back of the casing holding the powder together. Page said Olehy collected the cartridge and that it was the only cartridge recovered from the crime scene but they didn't take any photographs of it when they took it out of the ground.</li>
                  <li>CSI's (Page, Olehy, Datzman, and Sgt. Cody?) then walked through some of the areas where they thought the killer may have walked to look for evidence there. They walked from the bridge, down the side to the access road, and found the footprints. CSIs found footprints on the bank of the north side of the creek as well but dismissed them as having potential evidentiary value, however they did take photos of these.</li>
                  <li>There were some shoe impressions on the south side of the creek and a couple on the north side over along the bank. CSI's photographed some shoe impressions. They were skeptical of the value of these because of the search &mdash; just the fact that so many people had been going through this area in the course of that search, it was not going to be feasible to rule anything out or expect there to be integrity in that.</li>
                  <li>CSI's found nothing resembling a set of 3 footprints from the bridge going down to the creek.</li>

                  <li><strong>Approx 2:00 pm:</strong> Initially Holeman, and he thinks a lot of others, thought it was a failed sexual assault and maybe a kidnapping attempt and just because of the way the girls were found &mdash; “one completely naked, the other had clothes off and put some others on it” &mdashl and so he thinks that's where his mind went. He says he always thought it was 1 person but he didn't want to put blinders on so he kept an open mind and thought maybe it could be multiple but as the as the investigation went on it was clear to him that 1 person was capable, and did do this, “so the Odinist the ritualistic killing thing I never believed that um our crime scene investigators told us early on that the blood on the tree was blood spatter that it was not initially painted on there or put on there you could tell the difference. They could I mean you and I maybe not because that's not our specialty but our crime scene investigators at the time, Jason Page, had plenty of training in blood spatter and I would say he's a blood spatter expert so he was saying that that wasn't a symbol and, but again we didn't rule it out. The sticks to me look like just sticks randomly put on there with no purpose and that's what our crime scene investigators were telling us as well so we &mdash; I didn't believe it was realistic or ritualistic, but again we weren't going to leave any stones unturned so we did a thorough investigation, did research on that, and you know Behavior Analysis Units, professors, people that specialize in in those types of investigations and they were telling us that it's just not realistic. That it would be because if it was, there would be no doubt it it would be so obvious that it was but we &mdash; anybody would come and say 'hey I think it this can I look into it' 'yeah go ahead and look, let us know what you say' but no one could ever prove that it was some sort of ritualistic killing. </li>

                  There are still discrepancies with the State's timeline but as of now, this as close as it gets to all the publicly available information for February 13th, 2017. I regularly update it as new information becomes available but the most recent version of this work-in-progress timeline linking to all the cited entries can always be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1afuT1CgXSxZz9Sj37mA4_clWGdGATBCPLykPAtL3tgo/" target="_blank">here</a>.
